# The tragedy at Bedford bog - a visual novel

A historic recollection of the events authored by the internationally known Mr Thomlinson in visual novel form, expanding on events not originally included within the written format for brevity.

## About the project
This project was started to honour and celebrate the **original ao3 fanfiction** and the cultural significance of various myths and legends at King Edward VI's Grammar School.
**Mr Thomlinson** who wrote the work was always insistent on leaving a mark behind on the school as they left and established that the truth should not be forgotten just because a year turns to the next.
As such he began various restoration efforts such as the collation of the KEGS lore iceberg and the publishing of a number of documents that remain present on AO3.
